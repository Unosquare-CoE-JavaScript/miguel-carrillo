## Introduction to testing

Types of tests

- Unit tests: Isolated. Tests internal of a component
- Integration tests: How multiple units work together
- Functional tests: Test a particular function/behavior (Of the type “when a user does X, Y happens”). This is the type of test that RTL is optimized for.
- Acceptance / E2E Tests: Uses an actual browser (and server).

Run test in watch mode in create-react-app (runs jest in watch mode)

```json
npm test
```

Basic imports for tests:

```json
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
```

`render` creates a virtual DOM for the component passed. That virtual DOM can be accessed via `screen`.

**`describe`**

Describe function is a way of semantically grouping tests together.

## Assertions

Syntax: _expect_ (some element) + _matcher_ (what we want the state of the element to match)

Some examples:

```jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
...

expect(element.textContent).toBe('hello');
expect(elementsArray).toHaveLength(7);

expect(someButton).toBeEnabled();
expect(someButton).toBeDisabled();
// not is a matcher from jest-dom to negate the following matcher
expect(someCheckbox).toBeChecked();
expect(someCheckbox).not.toBeChecked();
```

> List of available matchers from jest-dom [https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom)

**jest-dom**

RTL imports jest-dom before each test, makes jest matchers available (i.e. toBeVisible(), toBeChecked())

**How RTL and jest work together:**

| RTL                                 | Jest                 |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Renders components into virtual DOM | Finds tests (files). |
| Searches virtual DOM.               | Run tests.           |
| Interacts with virtual DOM          | Make assertions      |

## Finding Elements

React Testing Library makes the following recommendation of priority to choose the query to find the tested element:

1. **Queries Accessible to Everyone**
   1. `getByRole`
   2. `getByLabelText`
   3. `getByPlaceholderText`
   4. `getByText`
   5. `getByDisplayValue`
2. **Semantic Queries**
   1. `getByAltText`
   2. `getByTitle`
3. **Test IDs**
   1. `getByTestId`

### TTD Summary

- Create a shell for the components.
- Decide Test flows
- Write tests for the final behavior wanted.
- “Make” test fails.
- Change the code until all tests passed.

## Test Interactivity

Test for click interaction on an element:

```jsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";
...
// click button
fireEvent.click(button);
```

How to find the roles in the JSX code using `logroles`

```jsx
import {logRoles} from '@testing-library/dom'
...
const { container } = render(<App />);
logRoles(container);
```

## Unit testing for functions

Sometimes you need to run unit test on functionality, even tough is not the primary use of RTL (which tests behavior).

When? When you need to cover a lot of edge cases or when you need to determine the reason for a functional test failure.

Example:

```jsx
import { functionToBeTested} from './App';
...
describe('test for the function group together', () => {
  test('returns the expected value', () => {
    expect(functionToBeTested(param)).toBe(returnValue);
  });
});
```

## Complex interactions

**`screen`** **Query Methods**

Besides the _getBy…_ query methods, RTL offers a range of possibilities for complex cases. The general syntax of a query is as such:

> _command_[All]By*QueryType*

_command_

- get: expect element to be in DOM
- query: expect element not to be in DOM
- find: expect element to appear async

[All]

- (exclude) expect only one match
- (include) expect more than one match

_QueryType_

- Role
- AltText (for images)
- Text
- PlaceholderText
- LabelText
- DisplayValue

Querying multiple elements:

```jsx
// When asserting an array of elements one way to tests is with toEqual
expect(altText).toEqual(["Chocolate scoop", "Vanilla scoop"]);
```

### user-event

`user-event` is a more complete simulation of real events from user interaction with the browser than `fireEvent`

- It simulates advanced browser interactions like clicks, typing, uploading, tabbing, etc.
- Replace `fireEvent` with user-event when possible.
- user-event documentation: [https://github.com/testing-library/user-event](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event)
- user-events APIs always return a promise.

### Test element disappearing from DOM (mouseover)

Implementation:

```jsx
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event";
// ...
test("Checkbox enables button on click", async () => {
  const user = userEvent.setup();

  // ...

  await user.click(checkbox);
  expect(confirmButton).toBeEnabled();
});
```

Note that because user-event returns a promise, the callback function in test must be async and we have to await for the interaction to complete (resolve).

Example with a popover component that responds to hover (mouseover).

```jsx
test("popover responds to hover", async () => {
  const user = userEvent.setup();
  render(<SummaryForm />);

  // popover starts out hidden
  const nullPopover = screen.queryByText(
    /no ice cream will actually be delivered/i
  );
  expect(nullPopover).not.toBeInTheDocument();

  // popover appears on mouseover of checkbox label
  const termsAndConditions = screen.getByText(/terms and conditions/i);
  await user.hover(termsAndConditions);
  const popover = screen.getByText(/no ice cream will actually be delivered/i);
  expect(popover).toBeInTheDocument();

  // popover disappears when we mouse out
  await user.unhover(termsAndConditions);
  expect(popover).not.toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

Note that first we use the `screen.queryByText` when the popover is not expected to be in the document and the `hover` and `unhover` methods form the user-event Convenience APIs [https://testing-library.com/docs/user-event/convenience](https://testing-library.com/docs/user-event/convenience)

## Mocking server responses and async app updates

Steps to mock a server response:

1 . Install Mock Service Worker

```jsx
npm install msw
```

2 . Create handlers

in /mocks/handlers.js

```jsx
import { rest } from "msw";

export const handlers = [
  rest.get("http://localhost:3030/scoops", (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(
      ctx.json([
        { name: "Chocolate", imagePath: "/images/chocolate.png" },
        { name: "Vanilla", imagePath: "/images/vanilla.png" },
      ])
    );
  }),
];
```

3 . Create test server

in /mocks/server.js

```jsx
import { setupServer } from "msw/node";
import { handlers } from "./handlers";

// This configures a request mocking server with the given request handlers.
export const server = setupServer(...handlers);
```

4 . Setup test server for all tests (And reset after each test)

in setupTests.js

```jsx
import { server } from "./mocks/server.js";
// Establish API mocking before all tests.
beforeAll(() => server.listen());

// Reset any request handlers that we may add during the tests,
// so they don't affect other tests.
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers());

// Clean up after the tests are finished.
afterAll(() => server.close());
```

### Awaiting DOM changes

When we are waiting for something to appear asynchronously on the page, we must use `await` and `findBy…` queries.

```jsx
// async callback function
test("displays image for each scoop option from server", async () => {
  render(<Options optionType="scoops" />);

  // find elements with await
  const scoopImages = await screen.findAllByRole("img", { name: /scoop$/i });

  // rest of the code...
});
```

**Example that reset the coded handlers to a server error 500**

```jsx
import { rest } from "msw";
import { server } from "../../../mocks/server";

test("handles error for scoops and toppings routes", async () => {
  server.resetHandlers(
    rest.get("http://localhost:3030/handler1", (req, res, ctx) =>
      res(ctx.status(500))
    ),
    rest.get("http://localhost:3030/handler2", (req, res, ctx) =>
      res(ctx.status(500))
    )
  );

  // rest of the code...
});
```

`waitFor`

Utility function when you need to wait for a period of time for the expectations to pass.

```jsx
import { render, screen, waitFor } from "@testing-library/react";

test("wait for several async operatins to finish", async () => {
  // ...

  await waitFor(async () => {
    const alerts = await screen.findAllByRole("alert");
    expect(alerts).toHaveLength(2);
  });
});
```

## Use global state (via context)

If we need to provide a context to a tested component, we can pass a `wrapper` as an option to the `render` method with the context provider

```jsx
render(<Component />, { wrapper: ContextProvider });
```

**Custom render**

If we need the context provider in many different test, or even other wrappers or global objects, makes sense to extend the `render` method with a custom render

```jsx
// test-utils.jsx
import { render } from "@testing-library/react";
import { ContextProvider } from "../contexts/ContextProvider";

const renderWithContext = (ui, options) =>
  render(ui, { wrapper: ContextProvider, ...options });

// re-export everything
export * from "@testing-library/react";

// override render method
export { renderWithContext as render };
```

To use it in the tests we import from this new testing library that re-exports everything from the original RTL.

```jsx
import { render, fireEvent, etc... } from '../test-utils';
```

## Questions to ask before writing a test

- What to render?
- Do we need to pass any props?
- Do we need to use a wrapper?
- In which file should the tests go?
- What behavior to test?
- What queries are needed?
- What events need to be triggered?
- Do we need to `await`?

```

**partial match for getByText:**

```jsx
const scoopsSubtotal = screen.getByText("Scoops total: $", { exact: false });
```

**“Happy path” tests**

Tests that execute a customer flow without errors

**Jest mock function**

When we need to pass as prop a function to a component, we can use `jest.fn()` , the function does not do anything but prevents the test from failing.

```jsx
render(<ComponentThatNeedsProps callback={jest.fn()} />;
```
