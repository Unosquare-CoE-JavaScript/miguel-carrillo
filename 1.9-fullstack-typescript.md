## What and why of GraphQL

> "A spec that describes a declarative query language that your clients can use to ask an API for the exact data they want. This is achieved by creating a strongly typed Schema for your API, ultimate flexibility in how your API can resolve data, and client queries validated against your Schema" - https://frontendmasters.com/courses/client-graphql-react/

It’s just a [spec](http://spec.graphql.org/). There are several implementations and variations

### On the server side prodives:

- Type Definitions
- Resolvers
- Query Definitions
- Mutation Definitions
- Composition
- Schema

### On the client side:

- Queries
- Mutations
- Fragments



## 1 - Create server

Example of the creation of a very complete Apollo Server integrated with Express, as a kind of middleware.

```ts
import { GraphQLFileLoader } from '@graphql-tools/graphql-file-loader';
import { loadSchemaSync } from '@graphql-tools/load';
import { ApolloServerPluginDrainHttpServer } from 'apollo-server-core';
import { ApolloServer, ExpressContext } from 'apollo-server-express';
import { GRAPHQL_SCHEMA_PATH } from './constants';
import * as express from 'express';
import { Server } from 'http';
import Db from './db';
import { addResolversToSchema } from '@graphql-tools/schema';
import { createResolvers, TwitterResolverContext } from './resolvers';

// loadSchemaSync is part of graphql-tools. Is loading the schema from an 
// external file. `GRAPHQL_SCHEMA_PATH` variable is the path of 
// the `schema.graphql` file.
const schema = loadSchemaSync(GRAPHQL_SCHEMA_PATH, {
  loaders: [new GraphQLFileLoader()],
});

// Returns the instatiated Apollo server to be used elsewhere
export async function createApolloServer(
  db: Db,
  httpServer: Server,
  app: express.Application
): Promise<ApolloServer<ExpressContext>> {
  const server = new ApolloServer({
    // As a global context besides the Db (here represented in the db object),
    // some caches are created for data that are heavily requested
    context: () =>
      ({
        db,
        dbTweetCache: {},
        dbTweetToFavoriteCountMap: {},
        dbUserCache: {},
      } as TwitterResolverContext),
    // Another tool from @graphql-tools, attaches the resolvers to its relevant 
    // types.
    schema: addResolversToSchema({
      schema: SCHEMA,
      resolvers: createResolvers(),
    }),
    plugins: [ApolloServerPluginDrainHttpServer({ httpServer })],
  });
  // Starts the server
  await server.start();
  // Connects to the express app
  server.applyMiddleware({ app });
  return server;
}
```


## 2 - Create graphQl schema

The schema acts as a contract between the client and the server, ensuring that the client knows exactly what data is available and what types, fields, and operations that can be queried.

Example that includes Queries (Retrieve data), Mutations (Update data) and Suscriptions (Receive real-time updates of changes).

```yaml
# schema.graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
  age: Int
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String!
  published: Boolean!
  author: User!
}

type Query {
  users: [User!]!
  user(id: ID!): User
  posts: [Post!]!
  post(id: ID!): Post
}

type Mutation {
  createUser(name: String!, email: String!, age: Int): User!
  updateUser(id: ID!, name: String, email: String, age: Int): User!
  deleteUser(id: ID!): User!
  createPost(title: String!, content: String!, published: Boolean!, authorId: ID!): Post!
  updatePost(id: ID!, title: String, content: String, published: Boolean): Post!
  deletePost(id: ID!): Post!
}

type Subscription {
  postCreated: Post!
  postUpdated: Post!
  postDeleted: Post!
}

schema {
  query: Query
  mutation: Mutation
  subscription: Subscription
}

```


## 3 - Create Resolvers

Is a good practice to break up the resolvers in different files that can be organized and group in a `resolvers.ts` general file:

```ts
// server/src/resolvers.ts
import { Resolvers } from './resolvers-types.generated';
import QueryResolver from './resolvers/Query';
import MutationResolver from './resolvers/Mutation';
import UserResolver from './resolvers/User';

export interface TwitterResolverContext {
  db: Db;
  dbUserCache: Record<string, DbUser>;
}

export function createResolvers(): Resolvers<ResolverContext> {
  const resolvers = {
    Query: QueryResolver,
    Mutation: MutationResolver,
    User: UserResolver,
  };
  return resolvers;
}
```

### Typed Resolvers

In the above code `createResolvers` has a type annotation that comes from `'./resolvers-types.generated'`.

To generate this types, we use a tool called GraphQL code generator https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen

To run it in yarn: `yarn graphql-codegen`

And to configure it for Typescript:

```yaml
# codegen.yml
schema: ../schema.graphql
generates:
  ./src/resolvers-types.generated.ts:
    plugins:
      - typescript
      - typescript-resolvers
```

### Codegen in the client

In the client code generation tool, generates the Typescript Types of the schema fields, the gql template literals and also typed hooks for the mutations.

```yaml
# client/codegen.yml
overwrite: true
schema: '../schema.graphql'
documents:
  - 'src/**/*.graphql'
  - 'src/**/*.tsx'
generates:
  src/generated/graphql.tsx:
    plugins:
      - 'typescript'
      - 'typescript-operations'
      - 'typescript-react-apollo'
```

## Setup Apollo client

> "Encapsulates HTTP logic used to interact with a GraphQL API. Doubles as a client side state management alternative as well. If your GraphQL API is also an Apollo Server, provides some extra features. Offers a plug approach for extending its capabilities. It’s also framework independent." - https://frontendmasters.com/courses/client-graphql-react/

Adding the Apollo client in the React App. Notice the `cache` parameter, the `uri` to the GraphQl API and the `<ApolloProvider>` that wraps the App.

```tsx
import { ApolloClient, ApolloProvider, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'http://localhost:3000/graphql',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
// ...
ReactDOM.render(
  <ErrorBoundary
    FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}
    onReset={() => {
      // reset the state of your app so the error doesn't happen again
    }}
  >
    <ApolloProvider client={client}>
      <App />
    </ApolloProvider>
  </ErrorBoundary>,
  app
);
```

## 4 - Queries

### In the server side

In the Resolver object

```ts
// Imports to type our return value
import { TwitterResolverContext } from '../resolvers';
import { QueryResolvers } from '../resolvers-types.generated';

const TwitterQueryResolver: QueryResolvers<TwitterResolverContext> = {
  currentUser: (_, __, { db }) => {
    const [firstUser] = db.getAllUsers();
    if (!firstUser)
      throw new Error(
        'currentUser was requested, but there are no users in the database'
      );
    return firstUser;
  },
  tweets: (
    _,
    __,
    { db, dbTweetToFavoriteCountMap, dbUserCache, dbTweetCache }
  ) => {
    db.getAllUsers().forEach((user) => {
      dbUserCache[user.id] = user;
    });
    db.getAllFavorites().forEach((favorite) => {
      const count = dbTweetToFavoriteCountMap[favorite.tweetId] || 0;
      dbTweetToFavoriteCountMap[favorite.tweetId] = count + 1;
    });
    return db.getAllTweets().map((t) => {
      dbTweetCache[t.id] = t;
      return t;
    });
  },
};
export default TwitterQueryResolver;
```

The resolver functions have three parameters (only the last one is been used in the example): the parent, the arguments of the request and the context. In this case in the context we have the Database object and also the caches created to save up in requests.

### In the client

Add the hook of the query

```tsx
import { gql } from "@apollo/client"
import { useGetCurrentUserQuery } from "./generated/graphql"
```

In the react function we use the ook before returning. The hook return three values: a loading state, an error and the data.

```tsx
const { loading, error, data } = useGetCurrentUserQuery()
if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>
if (error) return <p>Error: {error}</p>
if (!data) return <p>No data.</p>
const { currentUser, suggestions = [] } = data
```

Now we can used the destructure data.

> Everytime we make a change in the schema in backend or frontend, we have to run the code generator.

## 5 - Mutations

We already saw how to add a mutation to the schema

In the resolver (`server/src/resolvers/Mutation.ts`)

```ts
import { TwitterResolverContext } from "../resolvers"
import { MutationResolvers } from "../resolvers-types.generated"

const mutationTwitterResolver: MutationResolvers<TwitterResolverContext> =
  {
    async createTweet(_parent, args, { dbTweetCache, db }) {
      const { body, userId } = args
      const dbTweet = await db.createTweet({
        message: body,
        userId,
      })
      const dbTweetMap = (dbTweetCache ||= {})
      dbTweetMap[dbTweet.id] = dbTweet
      return dbTweet
    },
  }
export default mutationTwitterResolver
```

Notice that now it has to be an asynchronous method. (Also nitice how it is being saved in the cache)

## Caching

> "If you perform a mutation that updates or creates a single node, then apollo will update your cache automatically given the mutation and query has the same fields and id. 
> 
> If you perform a mutation that updates a node in a list or removes a node, you are responsible for updating any queries referencing that list or node. There are many ways to do this with apollo." - https://frontendmasters.com/courses/client-graphql-react/

### Refetching after a mutation

Example of updating the view for dependent data after a mutation:

```tsx
const [createNewTweet, { error }] = useCreateNewTweetMutation();

//...

void createNewTweet({
variables: { userId, body },
refetchQueries: [GET_TIMELINE_TWEETS, GET_CURRENT_USER],
})
.then(() => {
textarea.value = '';
})
.catch((err) => {
console.error('problem creating new tweet', err);
});
```

Where `useCreateNewTweetMutation` is a generated hook for the mutation (with codegen), and `[GET_TIMELINE_TWEETS, GET_CURRENT_USER]` are the GraphQl template literals of the data we want to refetch.
