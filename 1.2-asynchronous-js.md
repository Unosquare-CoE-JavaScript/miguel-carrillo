# Notes from the course "Asynchronous JavaScript Deep Dive"

## Understanding the event loop

JS is single threaded, so it can only execute one piece of code at a time.

The event loop makes possible to achieve asynchronicity because is able to set code aside (in a message queue), and take care of it once the main queue is empty.

## Callbacks

Callbacks are functions that are invoke or called after something else happens.

Are the tradictional way of executing code asynchronously, after antoher operation ends (But the presence of a callback doesn't make the code asynchronous!)

Basic example (with setTimeout):

```javascript
let callBack = function () {
  // some operations
};

// the function could also be declared anonymously in the parameters
setTimeout(callBack, 5000);
```

Another common use of callback is event listeners:

```javascript
btn.addEventListener("click", function(e) {
  // some operations
}):
```

Complex example using various scopes and closures:

```javascript
let processData = function (data, callback) {
  for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    if (typeof callback === "function") {
      callback(data[i]);
    }
  }
};

// Simple call with anonymous function
processData(someData, function (obj) {
  if (someCondition) {
    // some operations
  }
});

// more complex function with closure over the data and callback
let higherProcess = function () {
  let total = 0,
    count = 0;

  processData(someData, function (obj) {
    total = total + obj;
    count++;
  });

  // some other operations
};

higherProcess();
```

Problems with callbacks:

- Callback hell
- Difficult to reason about
- "Inversion of control"

Promises address those issues.

## Promises

A promise is an object that represents the eventual fullfilment or failure of an asynchronous operation. Always returns a value.

**_then method_**

We have access to this function once the promise is resolved successfully. Works similar to a callback.

To chain another promise we use the return of the previous _then_.

**_Chaining promises example:_**

Verbose version

```javascript
let firstPromise = asyncFunction();

let secondPromise = firstPromise.then(function (res) {
  // operations after the promise is resolved
  return otherAsynFunction();
});

secondPromise.then(function (res) {
  // operations after the second Promise is resolved
});
```

... chaining responses more concise

```javascript
asyncFunction()
  .then(function (res) {
    // operations after the promise is resolved
    return otherAsyncFunction(); // we need to return the second promise
  })
  .then(function (res) {
    // operations after the second promise is resolved
  });
```

Fetch example:

```javascript
fetch(url)
  .then(function (data) {
    return data.json(); // Usually we have to use the json method on the response.
  })
  .then(function (res) {
    // operations on the converted response.
  })
  .catch(function (err) {
    // operations on the error response.
  });
```

We can pass two functions to then ( the response and the reject)

```javascript
async().then(
  function (res) {},
  function (err) {}
);
```

### Create a promise

```javascript
// Set the promise with resolve and reject functions
let a = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  // 1. asynchronous operations...
  resolve(value);
});

a.then(
  function (val) {
    // 2. some operations on the payload if the promise fulfills...
  },
  function (val) {
    // 3. some operations on the payload (error) if the promise is rejected.
  }
);
```

### Asynchronous functions in Javascript

Since Javascript is single threaded, part or all of the implementation of this functions is handled by the engine or the system in order to be asynchronous (i.e: In setTimeout, the time is not counted by Javascript)

- setTimeout()
- setInterval()
- setImmediate() in node.js
- process.nextTick() in node.js
- readFile() in node.js

### Finally methods

you can chain this method in any promise chain and no matter what happens with the promise, it will execute.

```javascript
asyncFunction()
  .then((msg) => console.log(msg))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err))
  .finally(() => console.log("Cleaning up tasks."));
```

### Other static methods

**All**

This method returns a promise which will only be fulfilled once all of the promises in the array are fulfilled. If any of those promises are rejected the return promise is immediately rejected.

```javascript
Promise.all([firstPromise(), secondPromise(), ...])
  .then(function (result) {
    // result is an array of the resolve of all the promises
  })
  .catch(function (result) {
    // reject value
  });
```

**Race**

Only returns the value of the first promise that resolves.

```javascript
Promise.race([firstPromise(), secondPromise(), ...])
  .then(function (result) {
    // resolve of the quicker promise
  })
  .catch(function (result) {
    // reject value
  });
```

**allSettled**

Similar to `all` but doesn't reject the promise when one is rejected. Wait for the fullfilment of all promises doesn't matter if they resolve or reject.

**any**

Returns as soon as one of the promises is resolved (not rejected).

## Async / Await

The main purpose of async await is to simplify the code of promises.

The code will look like regular synchronous code but it will include the asynchronous functionality and by making the code look synchronous it is much easier to reason about.

> If `async` is used as part of a function definition, it forces the function to return a Promise.

**await Keyword**

- It can only be used inside an async function
- It waits for a promise
- It causes the async function to pause

```javascript
const asyncFun = async function () {
  let p1 = await promiseFun();
  // code that is runs once p1 is resolved to a value
};

asyncFun();
```

**fetch example**

```javascript
const swapiFilms = async function () {
  let url = "https://swapi.dev/api/films/",
    filmsData = {},
    // you can use then inside the async function
    filmsData = await fetch(url).then((data) => data.json());

  //processing data
};

swapiFilms();

console.log("Remaining Code");
```

**_Using async with an IIFE_**

You may need to use and immediately invoked function expression in order to encapsulate everything inside of a function so that you can use the async keyword.

```javascript
(async function () {
  let data = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos");
  let obj = await data.json();
  console.log(obj);
})();
```

## Generators

Basically a generator is a way to write code that you can pause and then continue at a later time.

A function becames a generator with the \* keyword.

To iterate the code in the function, you use the `next()` method, that runs the code until it encounters a yield. Each `next()` runs the code again.

```javascript
const test = function* () {
  yield 10;
  yield 20;
  yield 30;
};

let it = test();

test.next();
```

`next` returns an object with the value passed to yield and a "done" value.

**_Creating an iterator with generators_**

```javascript
let arr = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];

const arrIt = function* (arr) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    yield arr[i];
  }
};

let it = arrIt(arr);
```
