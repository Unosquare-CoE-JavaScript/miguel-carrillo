# Notes for the Git In-depth course in FrontEndMasters  https://frontendmasters.com/courses/git-in-depth/ 

## 1 - Some Concepts

### What git does
Git can be understood as a key-value storage system. The key is the hash (SHA1) and the value is the data. With the hash you can retrieve the data.

### Git objects

**Blob:** This object stores the data, plus some metadata (blob, size, \0)

**Trees:** Is where git finally stores the information. A tree contains pointers to blobs and to other trees.
 
**Commits:** A commit is a snapshot of the code at certain point. Is an object (pointer) that points to a tree. Also contains metadata: author, commiter, date, message, parent(s).

To see the contents of an object:

```bash git cat-file -p <object>```

A way to see a tree structure for the .git directory in windows:

```bash tree.com //a //f ```

### Git Areas

1.	Working Area
2.	Staging Area: The way git knows the differences
3.	Repository: All the commits. "Everything git knows"

## References and pointers

-	Tags
-	Branches
-	HEAD (current commit)



## 2 - Basic Operations

### Add (Stage) and Commit

To understand commits, it is important to understand the different code area that git implements, specially the staging area.

The staging area is how git knows what changes between the current commit and the next one.

Add file in the next commit: git add <file>

Remove a file in the next commit: git rm <file>

Rename a file in the next commit: git mv <file>

If you have done a lot of work between commits, this a very helpful commnad: ```bash Git add -p``` : stages in hunks interactively 

```git reset <file>``` to unstaged file (the changes remain in the working area).

Recomendations for a good commit:

- Good commit message
- One logical idea pero commit
- It should pass tests (No breaking changes)

## Stashing

It's a great way to save uncommitted work while you do other work without the changes getting in the way.

**Basic Stash Operations**

```git stash save "optional description"``` is recommended saving stashes with a descriptive name

```git stash list``` and ```gist stash show <stash name>``` to show the list of stashes or and individual stash.

```git stash apply``` apply stash

```git stash --include-untracked``` flag to stash all changed files including untracked.

## Tagging

```git tag <name>``` lightweight tag

```git tag -a <name> -m "description"``` annotated tag

```git show-ref --tags``` list of tags

```git tag --points-at <hash>``` all tags that point a particular pointer.

### Merging

when the base branch (the one you created your branch on) hasn't changed after you branched from it, git will make a fast-forward commit when branching. So it doesn't create a merge commit.

```git merge <branch>``` basic merge

```git merge --no-ff <branch>``` prevent fast forward commit, create a merge commit.

## Log and Show

Useful log flags

```git log --since="yesterday"``` shows all commits since yesterday

```git log --name-status --follow``` tracks all changes made to a fiel that has been renamed.

```git log --grep=<regex>``` find commits by a text search

```git log --diff-filter=R --find-renames``` find commits where files have been renamed

```git log --diff-filter=M --oneline``` find commits where files have been modified

```git branch --merged master``` list of merged branches

```git branch --no-merged master``` list of unmerged branches

### Git Reset

Three kinds, soft, mixed, hard.

move the HEAD pointer
the same plus copies the commit to the stashing area
the same plus copies the commit to the working area (destructive operation).

git reset ORIG_HEAD to go back from a reset.

### Fix Mistakes

There a three main methods of going back if we make a mistake in the commits.

```git checkout -- <file>``` checks out the last committed version of the file from the repository into the working directory.

```git reset``` Can be --hard, --mixed (default) or --hard.

```git revert```

main difference between reset and revert, is that reset changes history, and revert creates a revert commit.

### Rebase and Amend

**Amend**

As long as we haven't pushed our commit to a remote repository (like origin), we can amend the last commit to include changes.

```git commit --amend```

***Rebase***

Is used to integrate changes from one branch into another branch. Is similar to merge but rebase does it giving a new parent to the commit we want to start mering from (Rebase them, as in change the base).

Instead of creating a bunch of merge commits, rebase to replays the source branch commits on top of the receiver branch commits.

```git rebase master``` to rebase to the master branch

***Interactive Rebase***

For interactive rebase you pass in one commit before the one you want to start rebasing from.

```git rebase -i HEAD~2``` to rebase from 2 commits before HEAD


***Rebase pro tip:***

Make a copy of the current branch before rebasing

```git branch my_backup_branch```

If the rebase is completed but something went wrong:

```git reset my_backup_branch --hard```



## 3 - Git and Github

***Fork***

To create a fork click on the Fork button in the top right corner of the repository page.

Operations on remote repositories:

`git remote -v` list remotes

`git remote rename <old name> <new name>` rename the remote source

`git remote add` add a new remote

`git pull --rebase` Allows to keep the local fork up-to-date with a remote repo without merging.

### Git Hooks

Hooks are scripts that can run in different moments of the Commit/Push cycle, to automate functions as linting, messaging, documenting, etc.

To install a hook create an executable file and save it in the **.git/hooks/** directory

then make it executable with ```chmod +x [hook-name]```

Some hooks: pre-applypatch, pre-commit, pre-merge-commit, pre-push, pre-rebase, post-applypatch, post-commit, post-checkout, post-merge...

### Github API

Github exposes an API to create applications from the data it carries.

Github API can be used authenticated and unauthenticated (unauthenticated request are limited to 60 requests an hour)

***Some basic requests***

```https://api.github.com/users/${user}``` User information

```https://api.github.com/users/${user}/repos``` Last 30 repos of a user.

```https://api.github.com/repos/${user}/${repo}/languages``` languages used in the repo, with number of bytes of code written.
