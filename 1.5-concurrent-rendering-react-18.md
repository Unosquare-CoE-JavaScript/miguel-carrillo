# Notes on the course "Concurrent Rendering Adventures in React 18"

## 1 - Suspense

`<Suspend>` allows React pause the rendering of a component (or components subtree) that for some reason is not ready to be rendered.

A promise is invoqued, if it resolves the rendering continues, if it rejects, the "fallback" component is rendered instead.

Example of main/App component bounded with `<Suspense>` with a loader as a fallback until it resolves (swr used for data fetching)

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(
  <ErrorBoundary FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}>
    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
      <React.StrictMode>
        <SWRConfig value={{ fetcher, suspense: true }}>
          <App />
        </SWRConfig>
      </React.StrictMode>
    </Suspense>
  </ErrorBoundary>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

### Nest and parallelize components

Multiple suspense components can be nested. How is it resolved what part of the UI is replaced with what fallback?

React will use the closest parent suspense component of the subtree that is not ready.

You can have any combination of nested suspense components or siblings in parallel. The parent `<Suspense>` will resume when all promises are resolved.

```javascript
      <h4 className="text-center mt-5">User details</h4>
      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
          <AccountDetails userId={userId} />
      </Suspense>
      <h4 className="text-center mt-5">Favorite movie</h4>
      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
          <MovieDetails movieId={movieId} />
      </Suspense>
```

### Error handling

If a resource is requested and fails to load, an error is thrown.

`<ErrorBoundary>` catches the error. Similar to suspense boundaries, error boundaries can be nested.

## 2 - Changes in React 18

### Upgrading from React 17 to React 18

(From official documentation)

```javascript
// Before
import { render } from "react-dom";
const container = document.getElementById("app");
render(<App tab="home" />, container);

// After
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
const container = document.getElementById("app");
const root = createRoot(container); // createRoot(container!) if you use TypeScript
root.render(<App tab="home" />);
```

### useId() hook

Was called `useOpaqueIdentifier` in previous versions of React 18. Helps to generate a unique random identifier both in server and client. Can be use to "bind" html elements.

```javascript
import { useId } from "react";

export default function App() {
  const email = useId();

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor={email}>Enter Email</label>
        <input type="email" id={email} name="email" />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 3 - Concurrent mode

### Using `<SuspenseList>`

SuspenseList helps coordinate many components that can suspend by orchestrating the order in which these components are revealed to the user.

Example from React Documentation: https://17.reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-reference.html#usetransition

```javascript
<SuspenseList revealOrder="forwards" tail="collapsed">
  <Suspense fallback={"Loading..."}>
    <ProfilePicture id={1} />
  </Suspense>
  <Suspense fallback={"Loading..."}>
    <ProfilePicture id={2} />
  </Suspense>
  <Suspense fallback={"Loading..."}>
    <ProfilePicture id={3} />
  </Suspense>
  ...
</SuspenseList>
```

Possible reveal orders:

- "forwards"
- "backwards"
- "together"

The `tail` attribute control how the fallbacks are revealed. `collapsed` shows only the next fallback in the list. `hidden` doesnâ€™t show any unloaded items.

### What is concurrent mode

In concurrent mode, React 18 renders the components in chunks, briefly pauses between chunks and then renders the next one, until all the DOM is updated.

If some event occurs (like a click) during the rendering phase, now there's actually time for that event to be handled before everything is finished, making it faster.

**_Tearing of components_**

Different components could render with different versions of the state because of concurrent rendering. When different components are using different versions of the state, is called tearing of the components.

### startTransition()

This API is used to defer low priority work and make the app more responsive. Wrapping an operation in `startTransition()` makes it low priority and defers its completion when there's time available.

```javascript
startTransition(() => setMaxPrime(value));
```

### useTransition()

`useTransition()` is a hook that returns a `startTransition` instance and also a `isPending` flag indicating whether there are any pending updates.

```javascript
function App() {
  const [resource, setResource] = useState(initialResource);
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
  return (
    <>
      <button
        disabled={isPending}
        onClick={() => {
          startTransition(() => {
            const nextUserId = getNextId(resource.userId);
            setResource(fetchProfileData(nextUserId));
          });
        }}>
        Next
      </button>
      {isPending ? " Loading..." : null}
      <Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
        <ProfilePage resource={resource} />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  );
}
```

`useTransition()` makes an additional render with `isPending` so it takes a bit more time.

### How to use Suspense and useTransition() hook

Suspense can work together with a `startTransition()` function form the useTransition() hook.

### useDeferredValue

I used to keep a deffered version of a value, is used to keep the interface responsive if two components need the same value, but one needs it immediately and the other one has to wait.

Example from React Documentation: https://17.reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-reference.html#suspenselist

```javascript
function App() {
  const [text, setText] = useState("hello");
  const deferredText = useDeferredValue(text);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      {/* Keep passing the current text to the input */}
      <input value={text} onChange={handleChange} />
      ...
      {/* But the list is allowed to "lag behind" when necessary */}
      <MySlowList text={deferredText} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
