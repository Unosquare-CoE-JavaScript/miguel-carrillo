### Flexbox grid

Initial recommended setup:

```css
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}
```

### Steps to create a flexbox grid:

1 - Wrap each row in a parent container (for a row based layout)

```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="child"></div>
  <div class="child"></div>
  <div class="child"></div>
  <div class="child"></div>
</div>
```

2 - Decide the number of columns for the layout (the basis number before thinking about screen sizes) and the gap between columns.

3 - Setup the css for the rows with flexbox and for the columns adjust `flex-basis` for each case.

```css
.row {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row wrap;
  justify-content: space-between;
  gap: 4%;
}
.span1 {
  flex-basis: 22%;
}
```

4 - Figure out the percentage of each flex-basis taking into account the number of columns, gap and desired size of the element:

For example, for a 4 column layout with 4% gaps:

`100% - (3 gaps * 4%) = 88% left over for our 4 boxes.`

`88% / 4 = 22% per box. Set the flex-basis to 22% for this size of box.`

5 - Repeat the math for any size/percentage of content you need and create a class accordingly.

```css
.span2 {
  flex-basis: 48%;
}
.span3 {
  flex-basis: 74%;
}
.span4 {
  flex-basis: 100%;
}
```

6 - For responsive behavior, change the flex-basis of each type of element using media queries (Mobile first recommended).

7 - Some utility classes to fine tune the layout:

```css
.grow {
  flex-basis: auto;
}
.reverse {
  flex-flow: row-reverse wrap; /*for the row container*/
}
.order-1 {
  order: 1;
}
.order-2 {
  order: 2;
}
.order-3 {
  order: 3;
}
```

### Overlays

Microlayouts

flex allows to change from an horizontal to a vertical layout very easily
(example with the images captions)
