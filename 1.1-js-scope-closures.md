# Notes from "Yo don't know JS yet: Scopes and Closures"

## 1 - What is Scope and some definitions

**_Scope:_**

Are well-defined rules with which JS knows what variables are accessible by an statement, block or function. Code is parsed before execution in order to decide where to place variables, functions and blocks according to scope rules.

**_Lexical Scope_**

In the compilation phase a map is created, of all the scopes that the program will need while is executed. This model is called “lexical scope”.

> Variables are declared in specific scopes.

**_Nesting of scopes_**

One of the key aspects of _lexical scope_ is that any time an identifier reference cannot be found in the current scope, the next outer scope in the nesting is consulted; that process is repeated until an answer is found or there are no more scopes to consult.

## 2 - Shadowing

One variable declaration can override and prevent access to a declaration of the same name from an outer scope.

> Always use var for globals. Reserve let and const for block scopes.

## 3 - Scope of function expressions

**_Function declaration_**

```javascript
function nameOfFunction() {
  // ..
}
```

This type of declaration will create an identifier in its enclosing scope.

**_Function Expression_**

```javascript
var nameOfFunction = function functionIdentifier() {
  // ..
};
```

In this case the function will not hoist, also, the function identifier is declared as an identifier inside of the function itself.

**_Arrow functions_**

```javascript
var nameOfFunction = () => {
  // ..
};
```

Arrow functions follow the same lexical scope rules as regular functions do, they still create an inner scope.

## 4 - Some Global scope cases

Scope of modules (ESM):

All variables in the global scope are available inside the module's scope. The module wraps a scope similar to a function and the module’s top-level scope is descended from the global scope.

Global object in Node:

The top level accesible scope is never the global scope, because Node treats everything that it loads as a module, including the file that starts the node process.

## 5 - Variables

**_Hoisting:_**

Is the generation of runtime instructions in compile time for the automatisc registration of variables at the beginning of their respective scopes, each time the scope is entered.

**_Function Hoisting:_**

When a formal function declaration is used (not a function expression), the function is also auto-initialized. Hoisted functions attach to the nearest enclosing function scope (not a block scope).

**_var hoisting:_**

Also only attaches to enclosing function declarations. Are initialized to undefined.

**_let and const hoisting:_**

Attach to enclosing block scopes (or function scopes), but do not automatically initialize at the beginning of the scope.

> **_POLE_:** Expose the bare minimun necessary. Declare variables as nested and small a scope as possible, the benefits of the POLE principle are best achieved when you adopt the mindset of minimizing scope exposure by default, as a habit.

## 6 - IIFEs to create memoised cache:

here’s an example of a standalone IIFE:

```javascript
// outer scope
(function () {
  // inner hidden scope
})();
// more outer scope
```

How to use it to create a scope to hide variables/functions. Since it’s an expression, it can be used in any place in a JS program where an expression is allowed.

```javascript
var factorial = (function hideTheCache() {
  var cache = {};
  function factorial(x) {
    if (x < 2) return 1;
    if (!(x in cache)) {
      cache[x] = x * factorial(x - 1);
    }
    return cache[x];
  }
  return factorial;
})();
```

### Scoping with blocks

A block only becomes a scope if necessary, to contain its
block-scoped declarations (i.e., let or const)

```javascript
{
  // not necessarily a scope (yet)
  // ..
  // now we know the block needs to be a scope
  let thisIsNowAScope = true;
}
```

## 7 - Closures

**Definition:**

Closure is observed when a function uses variables from outer scopes even while running in a scope where those variables wouldn't be accessible. Is the link that connects that function to the scope/variables outside of itself, no matter where that function goes.

For variables we need to use over time, instead of placing them in larger outer scopes, we can encapsulate (more narrowly scope) them but still preserve access from inside functions, for broader use. Functions remember these referenced scoped variables via closure.

> Closure is a behavior of functions and only functions. For closure to be observed, a function must be in a different branch of the scope chain from where it was originally defined.

**_Basic Example:_**

```javascript
function lookupStudent(studentID) {
  var students = [
    { id: 14, name: "Kyle" },
    { id: 73, name: "Suzy" },
    { id: 112, name: "Frank" },
    { id: 6, name: "Sarah" },
  ];
  return function greetStudent(greeting) {
    var student = students.find((student) => student.id == studentID);
    return `${greeting}, ${student.name}!`;
  };
}
var chosenStudents = [lookupStudent(6), lookupStudent(112)];

// accessing the function's name:
chosenStudents[0].name;
// greetStudent
chosenStudents[0]("Hello");
// Hello, Sarah!
```

`greetStudent(..)` continues to have access to `students` and `studentID` even after the outer scope is finished.

**_The close-over variables can be updated!_**

```javascript
function makeCounter() {
var count = 0;
return getCurrent(){
count = count + 1;
return count;
};
}
var hits = makeCounter();
// later
hits(); // 1
// later
hits(); // 2
hits(); // 3
```

**_Use closures for:_**

- Efficiency, allowing a function instance to hold on to previous information instead of having to compute it each time.
- Readability, limiting scope-exposure of variables and making functions more especific with out needing all the parameters in every invocation.

## 8 - The module pattern

A module is a collection of related data and functions, characterized by a division between hidden private details and public accessible details, usually called the "public API."

**_Types of encapsulation:_**

- Namespace: Only functions without state.
- Data structures: Data and stateful functions but without limiting visibility of any of it.
- Modules: Grouping, state and control of visibility (private vs. public).

**_Classic Module example:_**

```javascript
var StudentList = (function defineModule(Student) {
  var elems = [];
  var publicAPI = {
    renderList() {
      // ..
    },
  };
  return publicAPI;
})(Student);
```

**_CommonJs and ESM modules:_**

The ESM format shares several similarities with the CommonJS format. ESM is file-based, and module instances are _singletons_, with everything private by default.
